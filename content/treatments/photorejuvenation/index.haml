%h1 IPL Photorejuvenation

%h2 Overview

%p
  The Pulsar Multifunction Intense Pulsed Light System is a technological breakthrough that can effectively and virtually without pain treat many conditions, including sun-damaged skin.

%p The treatment stimulates new cell growth and increases collagen production.

%h3 What will the treatment be like?
%p The procedure is as follows for all Pulsar IPL treatments:
%ol
  %li A trained / clinically certified person will always carry out the treatment.
  %li The area to be treated is prepared.
  %li A clear, hypo-allergenic gel is applied to cool the skin.
  %li The Pulsar Applicator is then applied directly to the skin and the selected area is treated via a series of intense bursts of light. Each burst of light represents a 5 square centimetre treated area.
