%h1 Diathermy treatment

%p
  Facial thread veins and skin tags on the body can now be removed with
  %strong short wave diathermy.

%p A minute needle is inserted into the blemish (as in thread veins) to disperse the contents and destroy the tissue by thermolysis (heat). A skin tag is removed with the needle and the area will become slightly crusty as the area blackens.

%p This technique is very effective and is widely used. Sometimes additional treatments are needed.
