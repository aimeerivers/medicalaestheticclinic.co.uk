h1. The Medical Aesthetic Clinic

This is a simple site that i make for a friend of mine. There's not really a lot to see here. I am rebuilding the site from a PHP content management system into a static content site generated by Webby. Content is written in haml using partials to avoid repetition. I am using Blueprint CSS as a style framework, modified to give greater spacing between the columns.

This is partly an exercise for me in how to make a good web design, so i am investing time into Balsamiq wireframes and mockups in the Gimp.
